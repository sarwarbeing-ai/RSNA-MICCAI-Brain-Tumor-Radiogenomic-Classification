A malignant tumor in the brain is a life-threatening condition. Known as glioblastoma, it's both the most common form of brain cancer in adults and the one with the worst prognosis, with median survival being less than a year. The presence of a specific genetic sequence in the tumor known as MGMT promoter methylation has been shown to be a favorable prognostic factor and a strong predictor of responsiveness to chemotherapy.


The job was to predict the genetic subtype of glioblastoma using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans.Model was built to detect for the presence of MGMT promoter methylation.The model was trained to predict the probability for the presence of MGMT promoter methylation.
